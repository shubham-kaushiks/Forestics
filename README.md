# Forestics
(Currently) It's a script that get's satellite images from a list of pre-determined coordinates using the Mapbox API, and using OpenCV, determines percentage of forest cover in that area. It's still in pre-pre-alpha state, we never really bothered to finish it, but soon.


We made this during an 8 hour hackathon in JIIT, Sector 128 hosted by DSC and won the first prize.
